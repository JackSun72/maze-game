# CSC207 Project Phase 0

## Requirements
You need JDK 14 to run this program. 
## Instructions
To execute this program, you have to run the Main class.

Then, enter 2 followed by return key in the console to sign up. Your username cannot be the same as someone else's.

To log in, enter 1 followed by your username and password.

After login, you are able to access login history, add user, delete user and exit by following the command table. To get administrative permission, contact the software developer.

IMPORTANT: Terminating the program through console (instead of selecting the exit option) will prevent any new data from being saved
Note: "cancel" is not a valid username (capitalization of the "cancel" does not matter - it is also invalid)
